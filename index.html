            <p >A UI UX designer is a professional who identifies new opportunities to create better user experiences. Aesthetically
            pleasing branding strategies help them effectively reach more customers. They also ensure that the end-to-end journey
            with their products or services meets desired outcomes.</p>

                <h3>1.Prototyping, wireframing, user flows, mockups</h3>
                <p class="p-description">A huge part of the product development process is envisioning what a product will look like. Depending on the stage of
                development, you might do this by creating wireframes, low or high-fidelity prototypes, mockups, or user flows. Let’s
                define these terms.</p>

                <h3>2. Visual design and design software</h3>
                <p>Both UX designers and UI designers use visual design software, like Figma, Sketch, Photoshop, and Illustrator, to create
                the visual elements of a product. Besides proficiency in the tools, you should build your knowledge of visual design
                best practices for things like typography, color theory, layout, icons, and general design theory.</p>

                <h3>3. User research and usability testing</h3>
                <p>To design a product that solves a user problem, meets a user need, or generally delights a user, you first need to
                understand who that user is. That’s where user research comes into play.
                
                Conducting the right type of user research for the product or feature you’re designing can empower you to make a product
                even better. As you develop prototypes, you’ll conduct user testing to validate your design choices. Knowing how to
                iterate through these two user-centric phases can help make you a more effective designer.
                
                This skill is so critical that some companies have a specialized role on their UX team known as the UX researcher.</p>
